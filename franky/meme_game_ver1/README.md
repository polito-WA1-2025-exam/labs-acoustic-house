# How to run this application

## Step 1: start the server

- open a new terminal window and navigate to the 'db_server' directory

        cd db_server

- run the following command:

        node server.mjs

If you see the message "Server ready Database connected" printed out in the terminal, the server is running properly.

_NOTE:_ all the needed modules are already installed and available in the 'node_modules' folder.

## Step 2: start the Web App

- open another terminal window and navigate to the 'meme_game_v1' directory:

        cd meme_game_v1

- run following command:

        npm run dev

Once both the server and the web app are running, you're all set to test this version of MemeGame!
